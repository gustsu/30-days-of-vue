### Day 1: April 22 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restarted  [Vue Mastery course one](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/event-handling). Made it to lesson 5 in the first course Intro to Vue.js.

**Thoughts**: Felt like this was a good tutorial to start with since I have already completed the first course once but that was a little while ago and I don't recall everything. I'm having with fun the course, adding my own css and assets to make it a little more unique. Vue seems pretty neat and easy to pick up.
